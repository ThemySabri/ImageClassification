# Data Mining and Warehouse\Image Classification with TensorFlow: Rock, Paper, Scissors

## Overview

This repository contains code and resources for building an image classification model using Python and the TensorFlow library. The goal of the project is to classify images of rock, paper, and scissors hand gestures. The model is trained on a dataset consisting of photos capturing these hand gestures in various poses.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation comprises a collection of images featuring individuals demonstrating rock, paper, and scissors hand gestures. The dataset is organized into respective folders for each gesture category, ensuring a balanced representation of each class.

## Model Architecture

The image classification model is built using TensorFlow and follows a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. The architecture is designed to effectively learn and classify hand gestures of rock, paper, and scissors.

## Customization

Feel free to customize and experiment with the model architecture, hyperparameters, and training pipeline to suit your specific requirements. You can also explore different pre-processing techniques and augmentations to enhance the model's robustness.
